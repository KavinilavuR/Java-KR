//Question:to write a java program to print "hi" 
//programming lang:java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hi");
    }
}

//java is case sensitive
//if "Main" or the class Name is made with a case error/capitalization error like "main"
//the case error of "Main" is "class main is public , should be declared in a file named main.java"
//file name should be same as of the class Name(here Main)
//println-represents print line(print whatever content inside ""(double quotes) and then move to next line(like adding a "\n" in C,C++)
//print-just print(just print whatever is inside ""(double quotes/variables) and stay in the same line dont move to next line
